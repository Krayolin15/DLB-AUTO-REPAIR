## 🏗️ Technical Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Modern Flexbox/Grid, custom Keyframes).

* **Iconography:** Boxicons Library.
* **Design:** Professional "Dark Mode" aesthetic with semi-transparent overlays for high readability against image backgrounds.

## 🔧 Core Functionalities

### 1. The Modal Engine

The application uses a centralized JavaScript object (`autoDetails`) to store service data. When a user clicks a service image, the script dynamically injects the relevant text into a generated modal, reducing HTML bloat and improving maintainability.

### 2. Adaptive Layouts

The stylesheet employs advanced media queries to restructure the layout based on viewport width:

* **Desktop:** Multi-column service grid and horizontal contact layout.
* **Tablet:** Dual-column grid with scaled-down typography.
* **Mobile:** Single-column stack with an overlay navigation menu.
